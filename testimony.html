            <p>
                I learned how to make a website that suits my taste, design on my own preference, and input what I want
                to
                display. I realize how fun, making a website is. While I'm still navigating the vast landscape of web
                development,
                the initial steps have been both exhilarating and challenging. The thrill of seeing my ideas take shape
                on
                the screen is undeniable, but the process has also revealed the depth and complexity of this field. I'm
                acutely aware that I've only scratched the surface of what there is to learn. The knowledge I've gained
                so
                far feels like the tip of an iceberg, with countless concepts and techniques waiting to be explored. It
                may
                not be easy now, but I'm hoping it'll get easy as I follow the guidelines of my instructors. "Never
                forget
                to commit" said one of my amazing instructor. This experience has not only taught me technical skills
                but
                also instilled a sense of self-discovery. As I continue down this path, I'm eager to delve deeper into
                the
                world of web development, knowing that the journey ahead will be filled with both obstacles and
                accomplisment. It's tiring but fun at the same time.
